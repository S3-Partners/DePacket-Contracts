2. **Multi-Token Support**: Compatible with major token standards including ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155.
3. **Flexible Distribution**: Offers both random and preset allocation methods, catering to different distribution needs.
4. **Customizable Parameters**: Users can set various parameters such as time locks, password protection, or specific claiming conditions.
5. **DApp Integration**: Designed to be easily integrated into existing decentralized applications, enhancing their functionality.
6. **On-chain Randomness**: Utilizes secure, on-chain random number generation for fair and transparent distribution.

## Applications

RedPacket finds application in various scenarios within the blockchain ecosystem:

- **Community Incentives**: Projects can use RedPacket to distribute tokens or NFTs to community members, fostering engagement and loyalty.
- **Marketing Campaigns**: Brands can create unique, gamified experiences for product launches or promotions.
